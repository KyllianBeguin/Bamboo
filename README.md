## About
I had this idea during my last years at Sup de Vinci school. At that time, we had to work on many data projects using web-scraped datasets. I found it a shame to work with such data when open data exist online... But the thing is that open data is real data, with a lack of "true use-case" data. Therefore, I started to imagine a way to provide students and other data enthusiasts a way to work with real data.

## Licence
Bamboo is under MIT Licence, more [information here](https://opensource.org/license/MIT)
